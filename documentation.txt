------------
In Postman we have to set up for each api
& also their is invisiblity for the no of api's.

Swagger is an open sorce api documentation 
framework to help developers to design ,
document, and consume restful web services.

It reads an api & extract in the form of 
interactive ui called Swagger UI.

It offers HTML view of API with JSON support.
Its a popular tool for generating interactive 
documentation from API.

For any change in code, it automatically reads
the code and update the Swagger UI.
